      <h1>Privacy Policy for MyDeenIslam</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> Feb 19, 2026</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>MyDeenIslam</strong> ("we,"
        "our," or "us") handles information when you use our mobile application.
        We are committed to protecting your privacy. By using MyDeenIslam, you
        agree to the practices described in this policy.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Information Collection and Use</h3>
      <p>
        MyDeenIslam requires certain device permissions to function correctly.
        We only access this data to deliver specific app features locally on
        your device.
        <strong
          >We do not collect, store on external servers, or share your personal
          data.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Location Services (Coarse and Fine Location):</strong> We
          request location access solely to calculate accurate prayer times
          (Salah) and to determine the correct Qibla direction based on your
          current geographical position. This data is processed locally on your
          device to fetch accurate timings and is never tracked or shared.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Microphone and Audio Settings (Record Audio / Modify
            Audio):</strong
          >
          Our application includes a technical library dependency that requests
          microphone and audio permissions.
          <span class="strong-text"
            >Please note: MyDeenIslam does not actively use your microphone. We
            do not record, listen to, collect, store, or transmit any audio data
            or conversations.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Storage (Read and Write External Storage):</strong> We request
          storage access to allow the app to save downloaded content (such as
          offline resources or personalized settings) directly to your device.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Notifications and Alarms (Post Notifications, Vibrate, System Alert
            Window):</strong
          >
          To ensure you receive timely prayer alerts, we use these permissions
          to send push notifications, trigger vibrations, and display Adhan
          (call to prayer) alerts over other apps at the correct times.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Internet Access:</strong> The app requires an internet
          connection to fetch updated prayer times and stream content.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. No Third-Party Services or Tracking</h3>
      <p>
        MyDeenIslam <strong>does not</strong> use any third-party analytics
        services, tracking tools, or advertising networks. We do not sell,
        trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties. All
        core functionality is designed to respect your privacy and keep your
        data on your device.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Data Security</h3>
      <p>
        We value your trust. Because we do not collect or store your personal
        data on external servers, your information remains as secure as the
        device you use the app on.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Children's Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not
        knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone,
        including children under 13.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Links to External Sites</h3>
      <p>
        This app may contain links to other educational or religious sites. If
        you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
        that these external sites are not operated by us, and we strongly advise
        you to review their specific Privacy Policies.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you
        of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are
        advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
      </p>
